        if: if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. 
        It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed otherwise not. 

          Syntax: 

           if(condition) 
            {
             // Statements to execute if
             // condition is true
            }

        */

            System.out.println("10 is less than 15");
 
        // This statement will be executed
        // as if considers one statement by default
        System.out.println("I am Not in if");
        System.out.println("\n");

        2. if-else: The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it wonâ€™t. But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false. 

             Syntax: 

                if (condition)
                  {
                   // Executes this block if
                   // condition is true
                  }
                else
                  {
                   // Executes this block if
                   // condition is false
                  }

        */

        if (i < 15)
            System.out.println("i is smaller than 15");
        else
            System.out.println("i is greater than 15");

        System.out.println("\n");
        
    }
}
